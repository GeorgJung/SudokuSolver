# SudokuSolver
A little Sudoku puzzle solver I created for my wife to participate in sweepstakes. We both don't see much fun in putting numbers in boxes, but she wanted to win some goodies. I suppose it's not cheating if instead of solving one puzzle after another, I solved them all at once... :wink:
